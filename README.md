To run this project you will need an Oracle SQL enviroment.
For online use, consider this: https://livesql.oracle.com

First run "table_creation.sql" to setup the backbone of our database

Next run "table_population.sql" to populate the database with sample database

Finally you can run "commands.sql" to see a list of different commands to run for an example of what powerful operations you can do.
